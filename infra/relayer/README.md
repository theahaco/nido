# Nido Relayer Runbook

## Purpose

The `nido` Fly app provides testnet gas abstraction for Nido smart accounts.
Wallets and dApps send a pre-signed Soroban authorization entry to the relayer;
the user does not sign a transaction envelope and does not pay XLM fees.

The deployed stack is:

- OpenZeppelin Relayer `v1.5.0`
- OpenZeppelin Channels plugin
- Caddy sidecar
- Upstash Redis
- three local Stellar keystores loaded from Fly secrets
- single Fly machine in org `aha-684`, region `iad`

Public browser traffic only reaches:

- `GET https://nido.fly.dev/api/v1/health`
- `POST https://nido.fly.dev/relay`

The OpenZeppelin authenticated API is not exposed publicly. Use a local Fly
tunnel for management operations.

## Request Flow

1. Frontend or dApp simulates an invoke transaction in recording mode.
2. User signs only the `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` with a passkey or delegated
   session passkey.
3. Client extracts:

   ```json
   {
     "func": "<HostFunction XDR>",
     "auth": ["<signed SorobanAuthorizationEntry XDR>"]
   }
   ```

4. Browser posts to `POST /relay` with no secret.
5. Caddy adds `Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY`, adds `x-api-key: nido-wallet`,
   rewrites to `/api/v1/plugins/channels/call`, and forwards to the relayer on
   `127.0.0.1:8090`.
6. Channels plugin re-simulates in enforce mode. This runs smart-account
   `__check_auth` and any policies, including spending limits.
7. A channel G-account becomes the inner transaction source.
8. The fund G-account fee-bumps and pays the Stellar fee.
9. Client polls the relayer transaction id until the plugin reports
   `confirmed`, `failed`, or `expired`.

## Current Testnet Accounts

These are public keys only. Secrets live in 1Password and Fly secrets.

| Relayer id | Role | Public G-address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channels-fund` | fee-bump fee source; simulation source | `GAL42RUBXKQSVSJWBXFTBB4GFKMPQXA3SOJVGP6UMRJT2SGEIR63JFK2` |
| `channel-001` | inner transaction source | `GA6QL5KWXBT5XPZ4CPJLYYJS4ARZVNEIUUXN5O3WQGFDMPJS2N34MRGR` |
| `channel-002` | inner transaction source | `GBRWPW26ZA4TCUPO7ADVAGDKU6TXQJE45LZTV7XSJY6SJDZV5R72TA5L` |

If keys are rotated, update this table and update all frontend build env that
uses `PUBLIC_RELAYER_SIM_SOURCE`.

Verify current addresses from boot logs:

```bash
fly logs -a nido --no-tail | grep "Syncing sequence"
```

Expected log shape:

```text
Syncing sequence for relayer: channel-001 (G...)
Syncing sequence for relayer: channel-002 (G...)
Syncing sequence for relayer: channels-fund (G...)
```

## One-Time Bootstrap

Run commands from the repo root unless noted.

```bash
# 1. Create the Fly app.
# Already done 2026-06-10; re-running errors harmlessly if app exists.
fly apps create nido --org aha-684

# 2. Create Redis and record the redis:// URL.
# Lost the output? `fly redis status nido-relayer-redis` re-prints it.
fly redis create --name nido-relayer-redis --org aha-684 --region iad --no-replicas

# 3. Generate keystores.
# Save this passphrase to 1Password before running. It is not recoverable.
KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE='<generate and save to 1Password first>' \
  ./infra/relayer/scripts/create-keys.sh /tmp/relayer-keys

# 4. Generate write-only secrets.
API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
PLUGIN_ADMIN_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Save API_KEY, PLUGIN_ADMIN_SECRET, and STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY to 1Password now.

# 5. Set all 8 Fly secrets in one call.
# macOS: use `openssl base64 -A -in <file>` instead of `base64 -w0 <file>`.
fly secrets set -a nido \
  REDIS_URL="<redis-url-from-step-2>" \
  API_KEY="$API_KEY" \
  STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
  KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE="<same passphrase used in step 3>" \
  PLUGIN_ADMIN_SECRET="$PLUGIN_ADMIN_SECRET" \
  KEYSTORE_FUND_B64="$(base64 -w0 /tmp/relayer-keys/fund.json)" \
  KEYSTORE_CHANNEL_001_B64="$(base64 -w0 /tmp/relayer-keys/channel-001.json)" \
  KEYSTORE_CHANNEL_002_B64="$(base64 -w0 /tmp/relayer-keys/channel-002.json)"

# 6. Deploy.
# --ha=false is mandatory. The positional directory is the Docker build context.
fly deploy infra/relayer --remote-only --ha=false
```

After deploy, confirm every generated secret value plus all three keystore JSON
files are stored in 1Password vault `theahaco`, then remove local copies:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/relayer-keys
```

## Fund And Activate

After first deploy, fund all three testnet G-accounts via Friendbot:

```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<fund-address>"
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<channel-001-address>"
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<channel-002-address>"
```

Restart so the relayer re-syncs funded balances:

```bash
fly apps restart nido
```

Activate the channel pool. The plugin will not relay transactions until the
pool is configured.

Terminal 1:

```bash
fly proxy 8090:8090 -a nido
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
API_KEY=<value-from-1Password> \
PLUGIN_ADMIN_SECRET=<value-from-1Password> \
  ./infra/relayer/scripts/activate-channels.sh http://localhost:8090
```

A `200` response with a success body confirms `channel-001` and `channel-002`
are registered.

## Smoke Tests

Health check:

```bash
curl -sS https://nido.fly.dev/api/v1/health
```

Expected response:

```text
OK
```

Plugin reachability:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://nido.fly.dev/relay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"params":{"getTransaction":{"transactionId":"nonexistent"}}}'
```

Expected: structured JSON from the plugin. It can be an error, but it must not
be a 404, HTML, or connection refusal.

End-to-end proof:

```bash
node scripts/relayer-proof.mjs https://nido.fly.dev
```

Expected: `PROOF OK`. The script asserts:

- transaction confirmed on testnet
- envelope is fee-bump
- fee source is not the user
- inner source is not the user
- user balance and sequence do not change
- landed host function and auth entry match the submitted request

## Deploys

Relayer deploys are handled by `.github/workflows/deploy-relayer.yml`.

Important invariants:

- Workflow only deploys on `main` changes under `infra/relayer/**` or manual
  dispatch.
- Workflow loads the Fly token via 1Password.
- Workflow uses `flyctl deploy infra/relayer --remote-only --ha=false`.
- Do not deploy with `--config infra/relayer/fly.toml` from repo root; Docker
  `COPY` paths rely on `infra/relayer` being the build context.

Frontend builds must set:

```bash
PUBLIC_RELAYER_URL=https://nido.fly.dev
PUBLIC_RELAYER_SIM_SOURCE=GAL42RUBXKQSVSJWBXFTBB4GFKMPQXA3SOJVGP6UMRJT2SGEIR63JFK2
```

`PUBLIC_RELAYER_SIM_SOURCE` is the fund account public key. It is only a
simulation source for recording-mode simulation; browser code never signs with
it and never spends from it.

## Secret Handling

- Fly secrets are write-only. `fly secrets list` shows digests only.
- Save each generated value to 1Password at creation time.
- Escape hatch for a lost deployed value:

  ```bash
  fly ssh console -a nido -C "printenv API_KEY"
  ```

- The bootstrap commands place secret material on the shell command line. Use a
  shell with `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` and prefix secret commands with a space,
  or read values through `op read`.
- `entrypoint.sh` writes keystore JSON files to `/app/config/keys` with
  `umask 077`, then unsets `KEYSTORE_*_B64`. `KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE` remains
  because OpenZeppelin Relayer reads it from env.
- Current signer backend is local keystore. This is acceptable for testnet only.
  Mainnet must migrate to KMS/HSM-backed signers before holding meaningful
  funds.

## Hard Safety Rules

### Run One Machine

Run exactly one Fly machine.

Every deploy must include `--ha=false`. Two relayer instances sharing Redis and
the same signer keys can race on sequence numbers and double-process queued
transactions, causing transaction failures and possible fund loss.

Do not scale horizontally unless each instance has distinct signer keys and the
Channels plugin queueing model has been re-reviewed.

### Keep Management Private

Public Caddy exposes only `/relay` and `/api/v1/health`.

Do not expose port `8090` publicly. Use `fly proxy 8090:8090 -a nido` for
management calls.

### Bound Fee Spend

`FEE_LIMIT=1000000000` stroops and `FEE_RESET_PERIOD_SECONDS=86400` cap fee
spend to 100 XLM/day globally. Without `FEE_LIMIT`, plugin fee tracking is
disabled.

Caddy stamps one shared `x-api-key`, so the budget is global, not per origin or
per user. Per-client API keys and origin-locked CORS are required before
mainnet.

## Operations

Check app health:

```bash
fly status -a nido
fly logs -a nido --no-tail
curl -sS https://nido.fly.dev/api/v1/health
```

Check public account balances:

```bash
curl -sS "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/<G-address>" | jq '.balances'
```

Check a relayed transaction:

```bash
curl -sS "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/transactions/<tx-hash>" \
  | jq '{hash, successful, source_account, fee_account, fee_charged, ledger}'
```

Healthy relayed transaction properties:

- `successful: true`
- `fee_account` is the fund account
- `source_account` is one of the channel accounts
- neither account is the user's C-address or G-address

If the first plugin call OOMs, increase memory:

```bash
fly scale memory 1024 -a nido
```

## Incident Response

### Relayer Returns 404

Likely Caddy route mismatch or wrong public path.

Check:

```bash
fly logs -a nido --no-tail
curl -i https://nido.fly.dev/api/v1/health
curl -i -X POST https://nido.fly.dev/relay -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"params":{}}'
```

### Relayer Returns Auth Errors

Likely Caddy did not inject `Authorization`, `API_KEY` secret is wrong, or the
request hit port `8090` directly.

Check:

```bash
fly ssh console -a nido -C "printenv API_KEY | wc -c"
fly logs -a nido --no-tail | grep -i auth
```

### Transactions Stay Pending Or Expire

Check channel activation and balances:

```bash
fly proxy 8090:8090 -a nido
API_KEY=<value-from-1Password> \
PLUGIN_ADMIN_SECRET=<value-from-1Password> \
  ./infra/relayer/scripts/activate-channels.sh http://localhost:8090
```

Then verify all three accounts are funded.

### Plugin Execution Timed Out

Account creation can take longer than a normal transfer because the factory
deploys a smart-account contract. Keep the Channels plugin timeout above the
default 30s window; `config/config.json` uses 120s.

### Fee Budget Exhausted

Symptoms: relayer rejects otherwise valid requests after enough successful
traffic.

Options:

- wait for `FEE_RESET_PERIOD_SECONDS`
- raise `FEE_LIMIT` temporarily and redeploy
- top up fund account if needed
- inspect traffic before raising limits

## Versioning

OpenZeppelin Relayer is pinned to `v1.5.0` intentionally. Stellar support is
still moving. Before upgrading:

1. Read OZ Relayer changelog and Channels plugin changelog.
2. Re-run `scripts/relayer-proof.mjs`.
3. Re-run wallet gasless transfer preview.
4. Re-run session-key tipping flow.
5. Confirm Caddy route and auth injection still match plugin API shape.

## Known Limitations

- CORS is wildcard.
- Rate limit is global: 20 req/s, burst 60.
- Fee budget is global.
- Local keystores are testnet-only operational posture.
- Memos are not supported on Soroban operations; do not include memos in relay
  requests.
- The relayer is now used for account creation; recovery rotation still has its
  own submission flow.
