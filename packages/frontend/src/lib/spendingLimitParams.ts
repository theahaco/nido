/**
 * Spending-limit install params for the spending-limit-policy contract.
 *
 * Encodes OpenZeppelin's `SpendingLimitAccountParams { spending_limit: i128
 * stroops, period_ledgers: u32 }` as an `xdr.ScVal` for the `policies` map in
 * `add_context_rule`. The bindings pass an `xdr.ScVal` through untouched, so
 * we hand the host EXACTLY the map the `#[contracttype]` struct expects.
 *
 * DUAL-SDK HAZARD (#72) — why this builds through the bindings' `Spec`
 * instead of `xdr.ScVal.scvMap(...)` from `@stellar/stellar-sdk`:
 *
 * In BROWSER builds, vite resolves the bare `@stellar/stellar-sdk` specifier
 * via the package's `browser` condition to the webpack bundle
 * (`dist/stellar-sdk.min.js`, with its own @stellar/stellar-base baked in),
 * but `@stellar/stellar-sdk/contract` — the subpath the GENERATED BINDINGS
 * import `Spec` from — has no `browser` condition and resolves to the CJS
 * `lib/` build with a SECOND stellar-base. An ScVal constructed from the
 * bare-specifier `xdr` then fails `val instanceof xdr.ScVal` inside the
 * bindings' `Spec.funcArgsToScVals` (it checks against ITS copy), falls
 * through to stellar-base's nativeToScVal and throws
 * "cannot interpret <minified-class> value as ScVal" before signing.
 * Node resolves both subpaths to `lib/` (one copy), so unit/integration
 * tests never see this — only browser bundles do.
 *
 * Building via `spec.nativeToScVal` + the spec's own `install_params` typedef
 * constructs the value inside the SAME stellar-base copy that later converts
 * the `add_context_rule` args (every `…/contract` import in one vite bundle
 * collapses to one module instance), and as a bonus derives the field
 * order/types from the contract spec instead of hand-encoding them.
 * Same hazard family as the XDR round-trips in
 * `examples/status-message-dapp/src/lib/nidoSign.ts` and
 * `packages/passkey-sdk/src/auth.ts` — if you hand xdr objects across the
 * page↔bindings boundary, cross that boundary in the bindings' domain.
