/**
 * Recovery *completion* (key rotation).
 *
 * Once friends have collected enough signatures, the recovering account needs
 * a transaction that rotates its signers: typically `add_signer(new passkey)`
 * on the default rule, optionally paired with `remove_signer(old signer id)`.
 *
 * That transaction is authorized NOT by the lost primary passkey but by the
 * recovery rule — a `CallContract(self)` rule gated by the multisig-policy.
 * So its `AuthPayload.context_rule_ids` must reference the recovery rule id,
 * and its `signers` map carries one `Delegated(friend)` entry per friend whose
 * signature counts toward the threshold (see `multiSigner.ts`).
 *
 * `planRotation` is a pure function (unit-testable, no RPC) that turns a
 * rotation request into the sequence of contract calls. `buildRotation`
 * threads those through the generated bindings to produce XDR operations,
 * mirroring `multisigRecovery.buildInstall`.
