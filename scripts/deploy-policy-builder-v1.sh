# Tasks 4 & 4b of the Policy Builder v1 plan:
#   - Publish + deploy the multisig-policy under its canonical registry name
#   - Ensure the WebAuthn verifier is registered by name (publish + deploy
#     if not)
#   - Publish the factory wasm, deploy a FRESH admin-capable factory
#     (passing --admin via __constructor), and repoint the registry
#     'factory' name to it (a pre-admin factory can't self-upgrade)
#
# Idempotent: each step checks current state and skips work that's already done.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-policy-builder-v1.sh <stellar-keys-alias> [network]
#
#   <alias>   Required. The `stellar keys` identity authorized to publish under
#             your registry namespace (see `stellar keys ls`).
#   [network] Optional, defaults to "testnet". Sets STELLAR_NETWORK for the
#             stellar-registry CLI (which doesn't accept --network directly).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - `stellar` CLI (>= 26)
#   - `just` available on PATH
#   - The deployed factory's existing contract ID matches FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID
#     below; if you've redeployed elsewhere, edit the constant or pass
#     FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID as an env var.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID  Existing deployed factory address (default = the
#                        testnet instance the frontend currently targets).
#   POLICY_VERSION       multisig-policy semantic version (default 0.1.0).
#   ACCOUNT_VERSION      smart-account wasm version to publish under
#                        unverified/smart-account (default 0.1.0). This is just
#                        the registry label; the factory deploys by sha256 of
#                        its embedded wasm, and this script asserts the
#                        published/installed bytes' hash matches that embedded
#                        wasm.
#   FACTORY_VERSION      factory wasm version to publish + deploy fresh from
#                        (default 0.4.0; the admin-capable factory).
#   REGISTRY_PREFIX      Prefix for unverified registry names (default
#                        "unverified/"). Set to "" to use the verified
#                        registry (requires curation rights).
#   SKIP_BUILD           If set, skip `just build-contracts`.
#
# Re-deploying a non-upgradable contract (factory / multisig-policy /
# verifier in their current form):
#
# None of the policy-builder-v1 contracts have admin()/upgrade(); to
# ship a new WASM you must deploy a fresh contract at a new address and
# repoint the registry name. Pattern (verified, used on testnet):
#
#   stellar contract deploy --wasm target/.../<name>.wasm \
#     --source-account <alias> --network <net>
#   # captures the new C-address
#
#   stellar contract invoke --id <REGISTRY> --source-account <alias> \
#     --network <net> -- update_contract_address \
#     --contract_name <name>             # bare, no prefix \
#     --new_address <new C-address>
#
# REGISTRY for testnet is CDBL7MNO7UI5OAAIC67UIWKQ4P3S6RVQSFCQXUHUW6TOFCXSYRPNHY4S
# (the unverified registry). The CLI's "registry deploy/upgrade" flow
# assumes a contract that can self-upgrade or be re-registered; the
# above manual pattern works when neither holds. See #25 / #26 for the
# long-term factory rewrite.

Summary:
  $POLICY_NAME@$POLICY_VERSION   $policy_addr
  $VERIFIER_NAME (registered)     $verifier_addr
  $ACCOUNT_NAME@$ACCOUNT_VERSION  $published_account_hash (published)
  $FACTORY_NAME                   $registered_factory (admin-capable, registered by name)

The multisig-policy contract and the WebAuthn verifier are now deployed and
registered. The policy-builder UI on /security can be used against any
existing account to set up recovery rules or delegate session keys —
add_context_rule + the registry resolution happen at the SDK layer, no
factory involvement needed.

Notes:
- The factory now carries an admin (set via __constructor at deploy time),
  so admin()/set_admin()/upgrade() work. A pre-admin factory CANNOT be
  upgraded in place (the constructor only runs on deploy), so this script
  deploys a FRESH factory at a new address and repoints the registry
  '$FACTORY_NAME' name to it. The admin is the deploying alias's public key
  ($ADMIN_ADDR). Newly-created accounts now resolve the verifier by name
  via the registry instead of a hardcoded lazy-deploy hash.
- Both the multisig-policy and the registered verifier are reachable by
  name via 'stellar registry fetch-contract-id <name> --source-account
  <alias>'. The SDK's policyChainFetch.fetchRegistryAddress(name) does the
  same simulate-only lookup at runtime.

Next: the policy-builder UI on /security is operational. Use the inline
forms to set up a recovery rule or delegate a session key on any account.
